In random forest - we create as many decision trees
as we can and then get predictions from eachof them

Training :
Given the whole dataset - create subsets of this dataset = no of decision tree you want
Create a decision tree for each of them

Testing:
given a datapoint:
get prediction from each tree
classification : hold a  majority vote
regression : get the mean of predtions
