In PCA - we decompose our dimension into lesser ones by maximizing the
variance to capture the data intricacies in bext way possible

Var(X) = 1/n sum( X_i - X_bar)**2)
Covariance of 2 features : (X,Y) = 1/n (X_i - X_bar)((Y_i - Y_bar).T)

Next we cn calculate the eigen values nad eigen vectors of this cov_matrix and
select the no of eigen vectors having thr highest variance = how
many dimensions we want in resulting data. These eigen vectors and eigen values
point in direction of highest varinace

Step : 01
Subract the mean from X
Calculate the cov of all columns with each other
calculate the eigen values and eigen vectors of this cov
sort these vectors in dec order of eigen values
choose first k eigen vect which would be the new  k dimensions
transform the n- dimensioned data to k-dimensioned data -> projection with dot
